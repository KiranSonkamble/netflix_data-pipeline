Using Azure resources and services

Using Workflow ingest the data to silver layer


Using "dbutils.jobs" we are passing the output of one task to another/ next activity.
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key=')


A static value can be passed directly between tasks but multiple values/ files/array values need tp be looped and processed within looped activity.
